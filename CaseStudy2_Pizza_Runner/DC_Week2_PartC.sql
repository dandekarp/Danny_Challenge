--1.What are the standard ingredients for each pizza?

select pn.pizza_name, STRING_AGG(t.topping_name,', ') as standard_toppings
from pizza_names pn
join ##pizza_recipes pr
on pn.pizza_id = pr.pizza_id
join pizza_toppings t
on pr.topping_id = t.topping_id
group by pizza_name

--2. What was the most commonly added extra?

SELECT TOP 1
       t.topping_name, 
       COUNT(x.extras_id) AS times_added
FROM   pizza_toppings AS t
JOIN   ##extras AS x
ON     t.topping_id = x.extras_id
GROUP  BY t.topping_name

--3.What was the most common exclusion?

SELECT TOP 1

FROM   pizza_toppings AS t
JOIN   ##exclusions AS e
ON     t.topping_id = e.exclusions_ids
GROUP  BY t.topping_name
ORDER  BY times_removed DESC

--4. Generate an order item for each record in the customers_orders table in the format of one of the following:
--Meat Lovers
--Meat Lovers - Exclude Beef
--Meat Lovers - Extra Bacon
--Meat Lovers - Exclude Cheese, Bacon - Extra Mushroom, Peppers

--5. Generate an alphabetically ordered comma separated ingredient list for each pizza order from the customer_orders table and add a 2x in front of any relevant ingredients
